import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Hello! My name is Arindaam and I love to develop secure backends of services that live on the internet.
Though I can't pinpoint when exactly I developed my interest in software, but I know that back in 2017 I loved solving [_CTF_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) puzzles - Turns out it can teach you a lot about linux.

Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege to work at *<Underlining>Square, a Insurance-tech company, a start-up, a student-led robotics team and one of the largest global open-source program</Underlining>*.
Currently, I'm a MS student at [*<Underlining>UC Davis</Underlining>*](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/) and a Graduate Student Researcher at [<Underlining>ExpoLab</Underlining>](https://expolab.org/) building a SDK for [<Underlining>ResilientDB</Underlining>](https://resilientdb.com/)

I also recently helped build the backend of a <a href="https://www.kadmik.in" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>**gamified EdTech start-up**</Underlining></a> from scratch.
