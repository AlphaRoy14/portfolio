#### Problem statement

Vaccine slots were limited compared to the huge population (of India) who wanted to get vaccinated. The only way to find a slot was to check the government website regularly which was very tiresome.

#### Solution
![Architecture ](./arch.jpg)

* Used the official open api from the indian govenment to develop a scalable vaccine email notification scheduler using Fastapi, MongoDB, Celery, React, AWS EBS for hosting and Redis as message broker. 
* Catered to over 5,000 subscribers.
