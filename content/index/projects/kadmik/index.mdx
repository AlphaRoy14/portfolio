* Kadmik is a gamified Indian govt. exam preperation app with over **8000 users**. Micro practice sessions are designed in the form of games such as _multiplayer_, _streak_, _arcade_ etc. 
* Built the backend (Fastapi, Postgres, AWS) of Kadmik from scratch; Collaborated in a team of 3 for system architecture and api security.
* Programmed a multithreaded game engine and employed Item Response Theory models for adaptive questions; Built scalable REST APIs and websocket endpoints; Cleaned and processed multiple data sources to assemble a multilingual question bank with over 250k questions.
* Slashed API latency by 75% by optimising SQL queries. Instrumented and profiled the backed code to identify bottlenecks.
